## Introduction

Hi we are in a robotics compition called FLL, and our team name is RobotMakers, and our names are Anika, Aidan, Ryan,Antoni, and Ariana. We all do FLL (First Lego League), and we all go to Noddin Elementry School, and for anyone who does'nt know about FLL its a robotics compition. We code on Pybricks Beta, which is like a python coding software, and in this repo we keep the code for the robot.
